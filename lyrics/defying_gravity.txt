GLINDA, [spoken]
Elphaba
Why couldn't you have stayed calm for once
Instead of flying off the handle?
I hope you're happy

GLINDA
I hope you're happy now
I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever
I hope you think you're clever

ELPHABA, [spoken]
I hope you're happy

ELPHABA
I hope you're happy too
I hope you're proud how you would
Grovel in submission to feed your own ambition

GLINDA & ELPHABA
So though I can't imagine how
I hope you're happy right now

GLINDA, [spoken]
Elphie, listen to me
Just say you're sorry

GLINDA
You can still be with the Wizard
What you've worked and waited for
You can have all you ever wanted

ELPHABA, [spoken]
I know

ELPHABA
But I don't want it
No, I can't want it anymore

Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by
The rules of someone else's game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes and leap

It's time to try defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

GLINDA
Can't I make you understand
You're having delusions of grandeur?

ELPHABA
I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But 'til I try, I'll never know
Too long, I've been afraid of
Losing love, I guess I've lost
Well, if that's love
It comes at much too high a cost

I'd sooner buy defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

ELPHABA, [spoken]
Come with me
Think of what we could do together

ELPHABA
Unlimited
Together, we're unlimited
Together, we'll be the greatest team there's ever been, Glinda
Dreams the way we planned 'em

GLINDA
If we work in tandem

GLINDA & ELPHABA
There's no fight we cannot win

Just you and I defying gravity
With you and I defying gravity

ELPHABA
They'll never bring us down

ELPHABA, [spoken]
Are you coming?

GLINDA
I hope you're happy
Now that you're choosing this

ELPHABA, [spoken]
You, too

ELPHABA
I hope it brings you bliss

GLINDA & ELPHABA
I really hope you get it
And you don't live to regret it
I hope you're happy in the end
I hope you're happy, my friend

ELPHABA, [spoken]
No, leave her alone!
She hasn't done anything wrong
I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want!
It's me!

ELPHABA
It's me

So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky
As someone told me lately
"Everyone deserves the chance to fly"
And if I'm flying solo
At least, I'm flying free
To those who'd ground me
Take a message back from me

Tell them how I'm defying gravity
I'm flying high, defying gravity
And soon, I'll match them in renown

Unlimited
Unlimited
Unlimited

ELPHABA, [spoken]
And, nobody in all of Oz

ELPHABA
No wizard that there is or was
Is ever gonna bring me down

GLINDA
I hope you're happy

[CITIZENS] OF OZ
Look at her! She's wicked!
Kill her!

[CITIZENS] OF OZ & ELPHABA
No one mourns the wicked (Bring me down)
So we've got to bring her

ELPHABA
Oh

[CITIZENS] OF OZ
Down
Down
Woah
