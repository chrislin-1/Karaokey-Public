[Intro]
(Mmm)

[Verse 1]
Now, here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat, (Heart) drives you mad (beat)
In the stillness (Still-) of remembering (-ness)
What you had (Lonely) and what you lost (Ooh, ooh)
And what you had (Ooh, ooh) and what you lost (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, "Women, they will come and they will go"
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Now, here I go again
I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to
Wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat, (Heart) drives you mad (beat)
In the stillness (Still-) of remembering (-ness)
What you had (Lonely) and what you lost (Ooh, ooh)
And what you had (Ooh, ooh) Ooh, what you lost (Ah, ah)

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's rainin'
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, "Women, they will come and they will go"
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

[Outro]
You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know
