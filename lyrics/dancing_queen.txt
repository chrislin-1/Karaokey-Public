[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, you can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 1]
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Mmm, where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

[Verse 2]
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Pre-Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 3]
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Pre-Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen
Digging the dancing queen
